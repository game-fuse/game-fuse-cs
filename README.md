# Game Fuse C#
Use Game Fuse C# in your Unity project to easily add authenticaion, user data, leaderboards, in game stores and more all without writing and hosting any servers, or writing any API code. Its never been easier to store your data online! Game Fuse is always free for hobby and small indie projects. With larger usage there are metered usage fees.

## Getting Started
The first step of integrating GameFuse with your project, is to make an account at https://www.gamefuse.co.
After creating your account, add your first game and note the ID and API Token.
With this setup, you can now connect via your game client. Download and unzip the code from https://github.com/game-fuse/game-fuse-cs
Add this to your Unity project in the Scripts folder.

At this point in time, you would add the prefab in this folder GameFuseInitializer
You can also build this manually by adding new GameObject to your first scene, and add a number of script componenets:
*GameFuse
*GameFuseLeaderboardEntry
*GameFuseUser
*GameFuseUtilities
*GameFuseStoreItem
